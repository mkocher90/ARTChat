# ARTChat
ARTChat is an anti-retroviral therapy prescription recommendation app developed by Manan Kocher as part of a 3 week Insight Data Science Fellowship project. The three main goals of this app are to (1) streamline prescription practices to save physicians time, (2) prioritize patient safety by providing data driven recommendations, and (3) improve patient education in their own treatment through an interactive interface. The FDA-approved list of HIV/ARTs, SIDER Side-effect resources, MEDRA database, and UCSF list of drug-drug interactions are used to create this app. Alternative therapies are recommended instantly. A mock-up of the app can be found at www.manankocher.com and an accompanying presentation can be found at bit.ly/artchat_hiv
If you are unable to open the jupyter notebook for any reason kindly consider the ARTChat_notebook.pdf which also contains the complete code.
